						<p>🇨🇳 Born and raised in Chongqing, China</p>
						<p>‍🎓 Senior at University of Michigan with a major in Information Science focusing on UX Design and Entrepreneurship</p>
						<p>‍‍🌟 Multidisciplinary designer with a focus on UX, product strategy and data-driven approaches</p>
						<br>
						<p>I explore my creativity in various domains including design, front-end dev, motion graphics, video production and entrepreneurship.
						</p>

						<p>When I’m not working, you can find me:</p>
						<p>‍•  grabbing coffee ☕️</p>
						<p>‍•  creating fun photos and videos 📷🎬</p>
						<p>‍•  going on adventures 🧗🏄🌊⛰⛸🛹🎿</p>

						<h1> What impact do I want to have on this world? </h1>
						<p> It is incredible to look back at how technology has advanced over the years to break the limitations that we used to have. As a designer working in tech, I want to design products that empower people to break through limits in life.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p> There are many different limitations that people are still facing in today’s world. Take my grandma for example. She learned to start a video call, but a call with her has never been smooth. She would always hold the phone close to her mouth when she talks and put the phone against her ear when I talk. This repeated process of moving the phone has accidentally ended the call; I could barely see her face, and she would sometimes mistakenly cover the mic with her thumb. I’m too old to understand this! She always gets upset and blames herself for making mistakes. However, I believe that a video call could be better designed into an easy experience for users like my grandma.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p> I believe that design can significantly contribute to creating a future where everyone has easy access to and delightful experiences with things they need. There are products today that have proven the power of design. For instance, the stock market had always been complicated for a lot of people — those who don’t have experience with stock trading, those who don’t have much money to invest and those who don’t understand the hundreds of metrics and charts on stock trading sites. By designing clean interfaces and intuitive experiences, Robinhood has managed to break the limitations and make stock trading easy for everyone.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p> After graduating from college, my goal is to work on products and technologies that help people break limitations. Later on, I want to use design to approach problems that people with limited resources around the world are facing.
